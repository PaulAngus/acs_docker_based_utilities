Git Summary
===========

Premise
-------

Self contained environment to:

1. create the tables which are used in a release's release notes to detail the changes that have been made since the last release.
2. use the above tables in conjuction with a version controlled text file which will form a periodic newsletter to the CloudStack mailing lists (and potentially beyond)

The PRs (open and closed) will be categorised via the labels attached to them

NOTE: analysis_git.py is designed to run outside of the surrounding app, so var initialisation will look a little clunky 

Label categorisation:
